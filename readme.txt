Hello. This is a basic text-based rpg.
You take quests from the guild, hunt enemies for gold and exp, and buy new weapons. Enemies scale with level

If you want to edit your save data, here is what each line refers to:
1.lvl
2.mhp
3.atk
4.def
5.spd
6.gold
7.equipped item id*
8.exp
9.guild rank
10.Inventory with item ids*
*the item IDs correspond with the number in the shop - 1
